# Data-Smart
Following Chapter 10 of the Data Smart book by John W. Foreman, These are my implementations in R of chapters 1-9.
This repository contains implementations of the following analytics techniques using R and Datasets in our *data* folder.

## Techniques Covered

1. K-Means Clustering on the WineKMC.csv dataset
2. Logistic Regression and Random Forest Modelling with the Pregnancy.csv and Pregnancy_Test.csv data
3. Time Series Forecasting on the SwordDemand.csv data
4. Identifying Outliers via Tukey Fences and Local Outlier Factorization  on the PregnancyDuration.csv and CallCenter.csv data

**This is for my future reference (and that of anyone else whose worked their way through the book)**
